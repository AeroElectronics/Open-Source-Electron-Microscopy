The backplane connects the various boards on the SEM control electronics. I have chosen to use a simple 'dumb' backplane which contains no electronics and simply connects the boards connectors together pin for pin.

I have also decided to use the PCIE X16 slot, because it is ubiquitous, capable, and low cost.
