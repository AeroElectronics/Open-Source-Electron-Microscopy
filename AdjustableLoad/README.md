This board serves two purposes:
1. Adding an adjustable load to the scan coil. Sometimes additional load resistance (or capacitance, will make another board soon...) can help the coil driver perform.
2. Can be used as an adjustable load with varied resistance or capacitance to test the coil over a range of inductances and resistances.

When designing deflection coil drivers for open source use it is difficult to know what sort of coil inductances they may be tasked with driving. It is necessary to evaluate their performance over a large range of inductive and resistive loads. For this purpose, a board was designed which allows resistors or inductors to be switched in and out of series so that a load with varied inductance and resistance may be created. Further, in some cases it may be useful to add resistance (or capacitance, which will be covered in another board) to the coil driverâ€™s load.
