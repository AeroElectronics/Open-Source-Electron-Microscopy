The raster generator is based on the LTC2754. It is a quad channel multiplying current output DAC with impressive specifications. My (as of yet untested) idea is to use two of the channels to create raster patterns and use the other two channels to attenuate those signals using the multiplying functionality. Ideally, this should provide attenuation and improve dynamic range, but it remains to be seen how well this will work. More to come.

I would hole off on trying to replicate this work until I spend some more time seeing if its going to work well.
