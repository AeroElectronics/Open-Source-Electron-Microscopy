To open and close valves, read out voltages, or do whatver other control related tasks.

These boards are both STM32 microcontrollers with opto isolated output and analog IO hooked up to some headphone jacks. There are two versions, one with the microcontroller on a daugter board and one with the microcontroller layed out on the boards.

I havent tested this board yet, so you may want to hold off until I do.
