# Design Status
Because of how new this repo is, many of the designs are recent iterations of old designs or new and untested designs. This should change and develop over time.

| Name | Picture  | Status |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|Backplane|![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/184fb932-40e5-4016-8bd3-8f4b4ee4be48)|Ready for use|
|Single Ended Deflection Coil Driver|![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56e2b2f6-02ce-431a-912b-e7b2cb1aa7a4)|This is a newer iteration of a partially tested design. Currently in testing.|
|Bridge Topology Howland Current Pump Deflection Coil Driver|![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e91abee4-31f4-4465-9c82-f694599c4e87)|Works, but has some performance limitations. New design with different opamps in progress.|
|Raster Generator (DAC)|![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48e5d483-d664-4cc3-ac6b-282a8ebd38c5)|This is adapted from analog device's demo circuit, but with some significant changes. Awaiting testing|
